The tensor-matrix product is a compute-bound tensor operations and required in various tensor methods, e.g. for computing the ALS or HOSVD.
%
This paper presents a high-performance algorithm for the mode-$q$ tensor-matrix multiplication using the Loops-over-\tf{GEMM}s (\tf{LOG}) approach with dense tensors that can have any linear tensor layout, tensor order and dimensions.
%
The proposed algorithm either directly calls efficient implementations of \tf{GEMM} with tensors or recursively apply \tf{GEMM} on higher-order tensor slices multiple times.
%
%They are applicable to dense tensors with any linear tensor layout, tensor order and dimensions which can be runtime variable.
%
We discuss different strategies for fusing and executing the matrix-matrix multiplication in parallel.
%
Using \tf{OpenBLAS}, our parallel implementation attains \tq Gflops/s in single precision on a Core i9-7900X Intel Xeon processor. %. that is $116$\% of the \tf{GEMV}'s sustained performance.
%
We show that the performance of our implementation is independent of the tensor layout and a performance of \tq can be sustained for any linear tensor format.
%
Our version of the tensor-matrix multiplication is on average \tq x and up to \tq x faster than state-of-the-art approaches.
